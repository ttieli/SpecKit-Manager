## 📊 Quick Decision Tree

```
Do you have a team of 2+ developers?
├─ YES → Use GitHub Actions (.github/workflows/deploy-simple.yml)
└─ NO → Continue...
    │
    Will you deploy more than once per week?
    ├─ YES → Use GitHub Actions
    └─ NO → Continue...
        │
        Is this a long-term project (> 1 month)?
        ├─ YES → Use GitHub Actions
        └─ NO → Use Manual Deployment (deploy-manual.sh)
```

**TL;DR:** Most projects should use GitHub Actions. Use manual only for quick MVP testing.

4. Understand why Firebase API keys are safe

### Intermediate (Deployed manually before)
1. Read **`DEPLOYMENT_COMPARISON.md`**
2. Understand GitHub Actions benefits
3. Follow **`QUICK_START.md`** → GitHub Actions setup
4. Deploy with `deploy-simple.yml`

### Advanced (Want full CI/CD)
1. Study **`deploy-advanced.yml`**
2. Understand validation and security scanning
3. Customize workflow for your needs
4. Add testing, notifications, multiple environments

## 🔐 Security Highlights

### Firebase API Key Safety ✅

**Key Finding:** Firebase API keys are SAFE to expose in client-side code.

**Why?**
- API keys only identify your project (not authorize access)
- Real security comes from Firebase Security Rules + Authentication
- Google's official documentation confirms this

**Still worried?**
- Enable Firebase App Check (recommended)
- Configure Firebase Security Rules (required)
- Restrict API keys to specific domains
- Monitor usage in Firebase Console

**Full details:** See `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` → Security Considerations

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting Quick Reference

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Workflow fails: "Permission denied" | Add `permissions: contents: write` to workflow |
| Placeholders visible on site | Check GitHub Secrets match exactly |
| GitHub Pages shows 404 | Wait 2 minutes, verify Pages settings |
| Firebase error: "Invalid API key" | Verify no extra spaces in secret value |

**Full troubleshooting:** See `QUICK_START.md` → Troubleshooting section

---

## 📦 What to Commit

### Always commit:
- ✅ `.github/workflows/*.yml` (one active workflow)
- ✅ `index.html` (with placeholders)
- ✅ `.env.example`
- ✅ `deploy-manual.sh`
- ✅ All documentation files

### Never commit:
- ❌ `.env` (contains actual secrets)
- ❌ `deploy-temp/` (temporary deployment directory)
- ❌ Firebase Admin SDK keys
- ❌ OAuth client secrets

**Verify:** Check `.gitignore` includes `.env`

---

## 🎓 Key Concepts

### 1. Firebase Config Injection
Replace placeholders in HTML with actual Firebase values during deployment.

**Why?** Keep secrets out of git, support multiple environments.

**How?** sed, envsubst, or dedicated GitHub Actions.

### 2. GitHub Actions vs Manual
**Actions:** Automated, consistent, team-friendly.
**Manual:** Simple, direct control, quick setup.

### 3. peaceiris/actions-gh-pages
Popular GitHub Action for deploying to gh-pages branch.

**Why use it?** Battle-tested, simple, supports all static sites.

### 4. gh-pages Branch
Special branch that GitHub Pages serves from.

**Workflow:** Main branch = source, gh-pages branch = deployed site.

## 💡 Tips & Best Practices

### Deployment
1. **Start simple** - Use `deploy-simple.yml` or manual first
2. **Test locally** - Verify HTML works before deploying
3. **Monitor first deploy** - Watch Actions tab for issues
4. **Wait patiently** - GitHub Pages needs 1-2 minutes to update

### Workflow Management
1. **One active workflow** - Disable or delete others
2. **Use descriptive commit messages** - Shows in deployment logs
3. **Test in branches** - Use PR checks before merging to main
4. **Version your workflows** - Comment changes in YAML

### Security
1. **Never commit .env** - Double-check `.gitignore`
2. **Rotate secrets regularly** - Update GitHub Secrets quarterly
3. **Enable Firebase App Check** - Extra protection layer
4. **Configure Security Rules** - Essential for production

### Team Collaboration
1. **Document decisions** - Why you chose a deployment method
2. **Share workflow logs** - When debugging issues
3. **Standardize on one method** - Don't mix manual and automated
4. **Review before deploy** - Use PRs for team review
