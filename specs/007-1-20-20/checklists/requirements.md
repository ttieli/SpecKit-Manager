## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All checklist items validated

### Content Quality Validation

1. **No implementation details**: ✅ PASS
   - Spec avoids mentioning CSS Grid/Flexbox as implementation (only in assumptions)
   - No JavaScript, HTML, or API specifics in requirements
   - All requirements focus on user-facing behavior

2. **Focused on user value**: ✅ PASS
   - Clear user stories explain why users need column customization
   - Each story articulates value (screen optimization, readability, layout stability)

3. **Written for non-technical stakeholders**: ✅ PASS
   - Language is accessible (no technical jargon in core sections)
   - Uses plain language: "columns", "font size", "readable" rather than technical terms

4. **All mandatory sections completed**: ✅ PASS
   - User Scenarios & Testing: ✓
   - Requirements: ✓
   - Success Criteria: ✓

### Requirement Completeness Validation

1. **No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers**: ✅ PASS
   - Zero clarification markers in the spec
   - All requirements are concrete and specific

2. **Requirements are testable**: ✅ PASS
   - FR-001: Testable by checking selector exists with 1-20 options
   - FR-002: Testable by selecting column count and counting columns
   - FR-003: Testable by reloading page and checking persistence
   - FR-004: Testable by measuring font sizes at different column counts
   - FR-005: Testable by checking viewport overflow
   - All other FRs have clear pass/fail criteria

3. **Success criteria are measurable**: ✅ PASS
   - SC-001: Binary (can select any count 1-20)
   - SC-002: Measurable (minimum 12px font size)
   - SC-003: Binary (no horizontal scrolling)
   - SC-004: Measurable (100% persistence rate)
   - SC-005: Measurable (under 1 second)
   - SC-006: Measurable (80px minimum width, legibility)
   - SC-007: Binary (features work correctly)

4. **Success criteria are technology-agnostic**: ✅ PASS
   - No mention of CSS, JavaScript, databases, frameworks
   - Focuses on user-observable outcomes
   - Uses measurements (pixels, seconds) rather than implementation details

5. **All acceptance scenarios defined**: ✅ PASS
   - User Story 1: 4 scenarios covering column selection and persistence
   - User Story 2: 4 scenarios covering font scaling ranges
   - User Story 3: 4 scenarios covering layout stability and responsiveness

6. **Edge cases identified**: ✅ PASS
   - Narrow mobile screens with high column counts
   - Long text overflow
   - Fewer commands than columns
   - Category interaction
   - Invalid saved preferences

7. **Scope is clearly bounded**: ✅ PASS
   - "Out of Scope" section explicitly lists 7 excluded features
   - Clear what IS included (1-20 column selection with font scaling)
   - Clear what is NOT included (auto-selection, per-category settings, custom widths)

8. **Dependencies and assumptions identified**: ✅ PASS
   - 4 dependencies listed (Feature 006, localStorage, category grouping, drag-and-drop)
   - 7 assumptions documented (display sizes, user preferences, font thresholds, etc.)

### Feature Readiness Validation

1. **All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria**: ✅ PASS
   - Each FR has implicit acceptance criteria via user story acceptance scenarios
   - FR-001: Covered by US1 scenarios 1-3
   - FR-003: Covered by US1 scenario 4
   - FR-004: Covered by US2 scenarios 1-3
   - FR-005: Covered by US3 scenario 1
   - All FRs traceable to user stories

2. **User scenarios cover primary flows**: ✅ PASS
   - US1: Core column selection flow
   - US2: Font scaling for readability
   - US3: Layout stability across all counts
   - Covers complete user journey from selection to persistence

3. **Feature meets measurable outcomes**: ✅ PASS
   - All success criteria map to functional requirements
   - All user stories have independent test criteria
   - Clear path to validation and acceptance

4. **No implementation details leak**: ✅ PASS
   - Spec remains implementation-agnostic in all requirement sections
   - Technical details only appear in Assumptions (where appropriate)
   - Modularity requirements focus on function naming conventions, not implementation

## Notes

- **Spec Quality**: Excellent - well-structured with clear prioritization
- **User Story Independence**: Each story can be developed, tested, and deployed independently
- **Measurability**: All success criteria have concrete metrics or binary outcomes
- **Clarity**: No ambiguous requirements requiring clarification
- **Readiness**: Ready for `/speckit.plan` phase

**Recommendation**: Proceed directly to planning phase - no clarifications needed
