# Specification Quality Checklist: Command Library Visual Enhancement

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-17
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All checklist items have been validated and passed:

**Content Quality**:
- ✓ Specification focuses on user needs (browsing efficiency, visual distinction, information density) without mentioning implementation technologies
- ✓ All content is written from user/business perspective
- ✓ All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

**Requirement Completeness**:
- ✓ No clarification markers needed - all requirements are clear and specific
- ✓ All functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-010) are testable with measurable criteria
- ✓ All success criteria (SC-001 through SC-007) include specific metrics (percentages, counts, timeframes)
- ✓ Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no mention of CSS, JavaScript, frameworks)
- ✓ Each user story includes detailed acceptance scenarios in Given/When/Then format
- ✓ Edge cases cover critical scenarios (20+ categories, mobile screens, color blindness, varying category sizes)
- ✓ Scope is bounded to command library visual enhancements only
- ✓ Modularity and Separation of Concerns requirements clearly define dependencies

**Feature Readiness**:
- ✓ All 10 functional requirements map to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- ✓ 3 prioritized user stories (P1: Content Browsing, P2: Category Colors, P3: Dense Layout) cover all primary flows
- ✓ 7 measurable success criteria directly validate functional requirements
- ✓ No implementation leakage detected

**Specification is READY for `/speckit.plan` phase**
