# Feature Specification: Command Library Visual Enhancement

**Feature Branch**: `006-`
**Created**: 2025-10-17
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "优化命令库的样式,一页可以显示多页内容,每个分类默认不同颜色"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - Efficient Content Browsing (Priority: P1)

As a user with many commands across multiple categories, I need to view all my commands in a single scrollable page so that I can quickly scan and access any command without clicking through multiple pages or tabs.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition - allowing users to see more content at once dramatically improves command discovery and access speed. Without this, users waste time navigating between pages.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by adding 50+ commands across 5 categories and verifying all are visible in one continuous scrollable view, delivering immediate improved browsing efficiency.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have 100 commands across 10 categories, **When** I open the command library tab, **Then** all categories and commands are displayed in a single continuous scrollable page without pagination controls
2. **Given** I am viewing the command library, **When** I scroll down, **Then** all categories remain accessible in a single vertical flow without requiring page changes
3. **Given** I have commands in multiple categories, **When** categories exceed viewport height, **Then** smooth scrolling allows me to navigate through all content seamlessly

---

### User Story 2 - Visual Category Distinction (Priority: P2)

As a user organizing commands by category, I need each category to have a distinct color so that I can instantly identify and differentiate between different command groups at a glance.

**Why this priority**: Color-coding significantly improves visual scanning and category recognition. This builds on P1's browsing improvements by making categories easier to distinguish when viewing many commands at once.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested independently by creating 5 different categories and verifying each has a unique, distinguishable color scheme that persists across sessions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have commands in 5 different categories, **When** I view the command library, **Then** each category displays with a unique color scheme that visually separates it from other categories
2. **Given** a category has been assigned a default color, **When** I reload the page or return to the command library, **Then** the same category displays with the same color consistently
3. **Given** I add a new category, **When** it is displayed for the first time, **Then** it receives a distinct color that doesn't conflict with existing category colors
4. **Given** I am scanning multiple categories, **When** I look at the category headers and command items, **Then** the color scheme makes it easy to visually separate different groups without reading labels

---

### User Story 3 - Dense Information Display (Priority: P3)

As a power user with an extensive command library, I want the layout to maximize information density while maintaining readability so that I can see more commands per screen without sacrificing usability.

**Why this priority**: This enhances the P1 experience by ensuring the continuous scroll view can display maximum content efficiently. It's lower priority because basic scrolling works without density optimization.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by comparing commands visible per viewport before and after changes, verifying at least 30% more commands are visible while maintaining minimum font sizes and spacing for readability.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have 50 commands, **When** I view the command library on a standard desktop screen, **Then** I can see at least 8-10 complete command items without scrolling
2. **Given** commands of varying text lengths, **When** displayed in the library, **Then** truncation and spacing allow maximum content visibility while keeping all text readable
3. **Given** I am using a mobile device, **When** I view the command library, **Then** the responsive layout maintains readability while still displaying more content than the current implementation

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user has 20+ categories (will color scheme still provide adequate visual distinction)?
- How does the system handle extremely long category names or command labels in the new layout?
- What happens on very small screens (mobile devices) when trying to maintain information density?
- How does color accessibility work for users with color blindness?
- What happens when a category has only 1-2 commands vs 50+ commands (visual balance)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right functional requirements.
-->

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST display all command categories and their items in a single continuous scrollable page without pagination controls
- **FR-002**: System MUST assign each category a unique, persistent default color from a predefined palette
- **FR-003**: System MUST automatically assign colors to new categories using a rotation algorithm that maximizes color distinction
- **FR-004**: System MUST persist category color assignments across sessions
- **FR-005**: System MUST display command items in a compact layout that maximizes visible content per viewport
- **FR-006**: Category color schemes MUST apply to both category headers and their associated command items
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain smooth scrolling performance with up to 500 commands
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain readability standards (minimum font sizes, contrast ratios) while optimizing information density
- **FR-009**: Color assignments MUST provide adequate contrast for text readability (WCAG AA minimum)
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide visual category separation through color while maintaining consistent command item layouts

### Modularity Requirements *(新增 / NEW - Constitution Principle VI)*

- **MR-001**: Feature MUST be implemented as 3 function groups (pseudo-modules): render*, color*, layout*
- **MR-002**: Function naming MUST follow conventions: render* for command library rendering, color* for category color management, layout* for density/spacing calculations
- **MR-003**: Function dependencies: render* functions can call color* and layout* functions; color* and layout* are independent from each other
- **MR-004**: Each function group will have dedicated test section in test-automation.html for isolated validation

### Separation of Concerns Requirements *(新增 / NEW - Constitution Principle VII)*

- **SC-001**: Feature touches all three layers: Data (category-color mapping persistence), Business Logic (color assignment algorithm, layout calculations), Presentation (rendering colored categories)
- **SC-002**: Layers communicate via function calls: Presentation → Business Logic → Data (one-way flow)
- **SC-003**: Prohibited: render* functions directly calling localStorage for color data; color* functions manipulating DOM elements directly

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **CategoryColorMapping**: Represents the persistent association between a category name and its assigned color, including properties like category identifier, color code (hex), assignment timestamp, and usage count
- **ColorPalette**: Represents the predefined set of available colors for category assignment, including color values, accessibility metadata (contrast ratios), and assignment order/priority

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can view their entire command library (100+ commands across 10 categories) in a single continuous scroll without pagination, improving command discovery time by at least 40%
- **SC-002**: Each category displays with a visually distinct color that persists across sessions with 100% consistency
- **SC-003**: Information density increases by at least 30% - users can see 8-10 command items per viewport on desktop (vs current 5-6) while maintaining WCAG AA contrast standards
- **SC-004**: Scrolling performance remains smooth (60fps) with up to 500 commands loaded
- **SC-005**: Category color assignments are visually distinguishable for at least 12 different categories before color repetition
- **SC-006**: 95% of users can successfully identify which category a command belongs to by visual scanning alone (color + header) within 3 seconds
- **SC-007**: Mobile users can view at least 50% more command items per screen compared to current layout while maintaining minimum readable font size (14px)
