# Quick Start: Cycle Management for Project Iterations

**Feature**: 004-cycle-management
**Date**: 2025-10-16
**Prerequisites**: Existing Spec Kit project with at least one iteration

## Overview

Cycle management enables you to track multiple review/revision rounds within a single iteration. Each cycle maintains independent data (inputs, notes, completion status), allowing you to iterate on your specification without losing historical versions.

## Key Concepts

### What is a Cycle?

A **cycle** represents a single review/revision round within an iteration. For example:
- **Cycle 1**: Initial specification draft
- **Cycle 2**: After client review and feedback
- **Cycle 3**: Final revision after security audit

### Why Use Cycles?

‚úÖ **Track iteration history**: See how your spec evolved across review rounds
‚úÖ **Preserve old versions**: Each cycle keeps its own inputs and notes
‚úÖ **Flexible workflow**: Add cycles as needed, no upfront planning required
‚úÖ **Data isolation**: Changes in one cycle don't affect others

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Automatic Migration (First Time)

When you first load the updated Spec Kit, **existing iterations will be automatically migrated**:

**Before Migration**:
```
Iteration: "Feature Implementation"
  ‚îú‚îÄ Input (specify): "Initial spec text"
  ‚îú‚îÄ Note (specify): "Client feedback needed"
  ‚îî‚îÄ Status: Completed
```

**After Migration**:
```
Iteration: "Feature Implementation"
  ‚îî‚îÄ Cycle 1: "Initial Cycle - Migrated 2025-10-16"
      ‚îú‚îÄ Input (specify): "Initial spec text"
      ‚îú‚îÄ Note (specify): "Client feedback needed"
      ‚îî‚îÄ Status: Completed
```

**No action required** - migration happens automatically and preserves all your data.

---

### 2. Viewing Cycles

When viewing an iteration, you'll see a **Cycle Selector** at the top:

```
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê

```

- **Dropdown**: Select which cycle to view/edit
- **‚ûï Button**: Add a new cycle
- **‚úèÔ∏è Button**: Rename current cycle
- **üóëÔ∏è Button**: Delete current cycle

---

### 3. Adding Your First New Cycle

**Scenario**: After client review, you need to create a second revision round.

**Steps**:
1. Click the **‚ûï (Add Cycle)** button
2. Enter cycle name: `"Client Review Round"` (or leave empty for default "Cycle 2")
3. Press **Enter** or click **OK**

**Result**:
- New cycle created and automatically selected
- All workflow steps reset to empty (clean slate for new round)
- Previous cycle preserved with all its data

**UI Changes**:
```

```

---

### 4. Switching Between Cycles

**Scenario**: You want to reference your original specification while working on the new cycle.

**Steps**:
1. Click the **cycle dropdown**
2. Select **"Initial Cycle"**

**Result**:
- Workflow instantly updates to show Initial Cycle's data
- All inputs, notes, and completion status reflect that cycle
- "Client Review Round" cycle data is preserved but not displayed

**Visual Indicator**:
- Selected cycle shows **(current)** in dropdown
- Cycle selector displays the active cycle name

---

### 5. Renaming a Cycle

**Scenario**: Default name "Cycle 2" isn't descriptive enough.

**Steps**:
1. Select the cycle you want to rename (or keep current if already selected)
2. Click the **‚úèÔ∏è (Rename)** button
3. Enter new name: `"Security Audit Revision"`
4. Press **Enter** or click **OK**

**Result**:
- Cycle name updated immediately in dropdown
- Name persists across all views and page refreshes

---

### 6. Deleting a Cycle

**Scenario**: You created a cycle by mistake or it's no longer relevant.

**Steps**:
1. Select the cycle you want to delete
2. Click the **üóëÔ∏è (Delete)** button
3. Read confirmation dialog carefully
4. Click **OK** to confirm (or **Cancel** to abort)

**Result**:
- Cycle removed from dropdown
- All cycle-specific data permanently deleted (inputs, notes, completion status)
- System auto-switches to previous or next cycle

**Safety Features**:
- ‚ùå Cannot delete if it's the only cycle (minimum 1 cycle required)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Confirmation dialog warns about permanent data loss
- üîÑ Auto-switch to adjacent cycle if deleting current cycle

---

## Common Workflows

### Workflow A: Specification Iteration

**Use Case**: Refining a specification through multiple review rounds

1. **Initial Draft** (Cycle 1: "Initial Cycle")
   - Write first draft of spec
   - Complete all workflow steps
   - Mark as completed

2. **Client Review** (Cycle 2: "Client Feedback Round")
   - Add new cycle: "Client Feedback Round"
   - Revise spec based on feedback
   - Add notes documenting client requests
   - Complete revised workflow

3. **Security Audit** (Cycle 3: "Security Review")
   - Add new cycle: "Security Review"
   - Incorporate security team feedback
   - Update plan with security requirements
   - Mark final version as completed

**Result**: Full audit trail of specification evolution

---

### Workflow B: Parallel Alternatives

**Use Case**: Exploring multiple design approaches before committing

1. **Baseline** (Cycle 1: "Initial Approach")
   - Document first approach (e.g., REST API)
   - Complete initial plan

2. **Alternative A** (Cycle 2: "GraphQL Approach")
   - Add new cycle: "GraphQL Approach"
   - Document alternative design
   - Compare pros/cons in notes

3. **Alternative B** (Cycle 3: "gRPC Approach")
   - Add new cycle: "gRPC Approach"
   - Document third option
   - Evaluate tradeoffs

4. **Final Decision**
   - Review all three cycles
   - Delete unchosen alternatives (or keep for reference)
   - Rename chosen cycle to "Final Design"

---

### Workflow C: Incremental Refinement

**Use Case**: Continuous improvement over time

1. **MVP** (Cycle 1: "V1.0 - MVP")
   - Minimal viable specification
   - Focus on core requirements

2. **Enhancement** (Cycle 2: "V1.1 - UX Improvements")
   - Add UX feedback
   - Expand on user scenarios

3. **Performance** (Cycle 3: "V1.2 - Performance Tuning")
   - Add performance requirements
   - Document optimization strategies

**Result**: Versioned specification with clear progression

---

## Best Practices

### Naming Conventions

‚úÖ **Good cycle names**:
- Descriptive: "Client Review Round", "Security Audit", "Final Revision"
- Versioned: "V1.0 - Initial", "V2.0 - After Feedback"
- Dated: "2025-10-16 Draft", "November Review"

‚ùå **Avoid**:
- Generic: "Cycle 2", "Cycle 3" (default names, not meaningful)
- Ambiguous: "Changes", "Updates" (what kind of changes?)
- Too long: Names exceeding 50 characters are truncated

### When to Add a Cycle

‚úÖ **Good reasons to add a cycle**:
- After a major review (client, security, legal)
- When pivoting approach (architectural change)
- When requirements change significantly
- To preserve a milestone version

‚ùå **Don't add a cycle for**:
- Minor typo fixes (just edit current cycle)
- Work in progress (continue in current cycle)
- Daily updates (cycles are for major revisions)

### Managing Many Cycles

**Recommended**: 3-5 cycles per iteration

**If you have >5 cycles**:
- Consider whether some cycles can be deleted (obsolete drafts)
- Use descriptive names to quickly identify relevant cycles
- Delete early exploratory cycles once direction is decided

**If you have >10 cycles**:
- Pagination activates automatically
- Search/filter helps find cycles quickly
- Consider splitting into separate iterations if representing different features

## Data Management

### What Data is Cycle-Specific?

Each cycle maintains **independent copies** of:
- ‚úÖ **Inputs**: Text entered in each workflow step
- ‚úÖ **Notes**: Notes attached to each step
- ‚úÖ **Completion Status**: Which steps are marked complete
- ‚úÖ **Completion Timestamps**: When steps were completed

### What Data is Iteration-Level?

These fields are **shared across all cycles**:
- Iteration name
- Iteration description
- Iteration creation date

### Data Persistence

- **LocalStorage**: Primary storage, works offline
- **Firebase**: Optional sync if authenticated
- **Backup**: Automatic backup before destructive operations (delete)

### Backup and Recovery

**Before deletion**: System creates backup in `localStorage` under key `spec_kit_backup`

**Retention**: Backup retained for 24 hours

**Manual backup**: Export projects via existing export functionality

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Action | Shortcut |
|--------|----------|
| Add Cycle | *(Click ‚ûï button)* |
| Rename Cycle | *(Click ‚úèÔ∏è button)* |
| Delete Cycle | *(Click üóëÔ∏è button)* |
| Switch Cycle | *(Use dropdown or arrow keys when focused)* |
| Confirm Inline Edit | **Enter** |
| Cancel Inline Edit | **Escape** |

## Troubleshooting

### "Cannot delete the last cycle"

**Problem**: You're trying to delete the only remaining cycle

**Solution**: Each iteration must have at least one cycle. Add a new cycle before deleting the current one, or keep the existing cycle.

---

### Cycle name appears truncated

**Problem**: Long cycle names show "..." in dropdown

**Solution**: Hover over the cycle name to see the full name in a tooltip. Consider shortening the name using the rename function.

---

### Changes not saving

**Problem**: Cycle operations (add/rename/delete) don't persist

**Possible Causes**:
1. **LocalStorage Full**: Browser storage quota exceeded (5-10 MB limit)
   - Solution: Delete old projects or cycles
   - Check browser console for quota errors

2. **Browser Restrictions**: Private/Incognito mode may limit storage
   - Solution: Use normal browsing mode

3. **JavaScript Error**: Check browser console for errors
   - Solution: Refresh page, report bug if persistent

---

### Lost cycle after refresh

**Problem**: Created cycle disappeared after page reload

**Cause**: Save operation failed silently

**Solution**:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Ensure LocalStorage is enabled
3. Try creating cycle again
4. Contact support if issue persists

---

### Cycles appear out of order

**Problem**: Cycles not sorted chronologically

**Expected Behavior**: Cycles should display in creation order (oldest to newest)

**Solution**:
- This is a bug - cycles should auto-sort by `order` field
- Workaround: Rename cycles with numeric prefixes (1-, 2-, 3-)
- Report issue with screenshot

---

## Performance Expectations

| Operation | Expected Time |
|-----------|---------------|
| Add Cycle | < 5 seconds (3 clicks) |
| Rename Cycle | < 10 seconds (2 clicks + typing) |
| Delete Cycle | < 5 seconds (2 clicks) |
| Switch Cycle | < 100ms (UI update) |
| Load Iteration | < 500ms (up to 20 cycles) |

**If operations are slower**: Check number of cycles (>20 may impact performance)

---

## Next Steps

### After Adding Your First Cycle

1. ‚úÖ Complete the workflow in the new cycle
2. ‚úÖ Switch back to review previous cycle's data
3. ‚úÖ Rename cycles with meaningful names
4. ‚úÖ Delete obsolete or exploratory cycles

### Advanced Usage

1. **Export Cycle Data**: Use existing project export (includes all cycles)
2. **Share Iterations**: Firebase sync includes all cycle data
3. **Track Cycle Metrics**: View completion timestamps in cycleHistory

## FAQ

### Q: Can I copy data from one cycle to another?

**A**: Not in the initial release. Each cycle starts with a clean slate. Copy-paste manually if needed.

**Future**: Cycle duplication feature may be added in future iteration.

---

### Q: Can I reorder cycles?

**A**: No. Cycles are always displayed in chronological order (creation date). Rename cycles to add context (e.g., "1 - Initial", "2 - Review").

---

### Q: What happens to cycle data when I delete an iteration?

**A**: All cycles and their data are permanently deleted along with the iteration. This matches existing behavior - no change.

---

### Q: Can I have different cycle names in different iterations?

**A**: Yes. Cycle names are scoped to their iteration. Two iterations can both have a cycle named "Initial Draft" without conflict.

---

### Q: Is there a limit to the number of cycles?

**A**: No hard limit, but performance is optimized for 3-5 cycles (tested up to 20 cycles). Beyond 20 cycles, consider splitting into separate iterations.

---

### Q: Can I export cycle data separately?

**A**: Not directly. Use the existing project export function, which includes all cycles. Filter cycles manually after export if needed.

---

### Q: Does cycle management work offline?

**A**: Yes. All cycle operations use LocalStorage as primary storage. Firebase sync is optional and only runs when authenticated and online.

---

### Q: Can I undo cycle deletion?

**A**: No undo functionality in initial release. A backup is created before deletion, but manual recovery requires technical knowledge. **Be cautious when deleting cycles.**
