# Specification Quality Checklist: Cloud-First Data Synchronization Strategy

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Validation Notes**:
- ✅ Spec is technology-agnostic (mentions Firebase as existing dependency but no new tech introduced)
- ✅ Business value clearly articulated: "Users lose trust when deleted projects mysteriously reappear"
- ✅ Written in plain language understandable by product managers and stakeholders
- ✅ All mandatory sections present: User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Validation Notes**:
- ✅ Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements concrete
- ✅ Each FR has clear pass/fail condition (e.g., FR-003: "MUST replace local data when cloud timestamp is newer")
- ✅ Success criteria measurable: "within 5 seconds", "100% of the time", "0% data loss"
- ✅ No tech stack mentioned in success criteria (e.g., "Users see latest version" not "Firebase sync completes")
- ✅ 11 acceptance scenarios across 3 user stories with Given/When/Then format
- ✅ 4 edge cases identified with resolution strategies
- ✅ Out of Scope section clearly bounds feature (no undo, no audit trail, no partial sync)
- ✅ Dependencies section lists 4 items; Assumptions section lists 6 items

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Validation Notes**:
- ✅ FR-001 to FR-010 all testable (e.g., FR-009: "record deletion timestamp" → verifiable via cloud DB inspection)
- ✅ Primary flows covered: delete sync (US1), conflict resolution (US2), offline queue (US3)
- ✅ 6 measurable outcomes align with 10 functional requirements
- ✅ No code snippets, function names, or database schemas in spec (separation of concerns)

## Summary

**Status**: ✅ **READY FOR PLANNING**

**Strengths**:
1. Clear problem statement with user pain point ("deleted projects coming back")
2. Concrete acceptance scenarios with timestamps (T1, T2) for conflict testing
3. Comprehensive edge case coverage (clock skew, simultaneous edits, corrupted data)
4. Well-defined success metrics with quantitative targets

**No Issues Found**: All checklist items pass. Specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for `/speckit.plan`.

**Recommended Next Steps**:
1. Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation design
2. Consider adding performance benchmarks for timestamp comparison operations during planning phase
3. Document rollback procedure in implementation plan (mentioned in Backward Compatibility but needs detail)
