# Specification Quality Checklist: Enhanced Project Management and Command Library

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality: ✅ PASS

1. **No implementation details**: PASS - The spec focuses on user-facing behaviors and avoids technical implementation. Modularity and Separation of Concerns requirements are architectural constraints (constitutional), not implementation details.
2. **User value focused**: PASS - All three user stories clearly articulate user needs and business value.
3. **Non-technical language**: PASS - Spec uses business language like "project management", "progress indicators", "command library" rather than technical jargon.
4. **Mandatory sections**: PASS - All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete.

### Requirement Completeness: ✅ PASS

1. **No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers**: PASS - All requirements are concrete with reasonable defaults documented in Assumptions section.
2. **Testable requirements**: PASS - All 16 functional requirements are testable (e.g., FR-001 "edit project names inline" can be verified by performing the edit action).
3. **Measurable success criteria**: PASS - All 8 success criteria include specific metrics (e.g., SC-001 "within 30 seconds", SC-002 "less than 100ms", SC-003 "95%").
4. **Technology-agnostic success criteria**: PASS - Success criteria focus on user outcomes (e.g., "Users can perform operations within 30 seconds") rather than technical metrics.
5. **Acceptance scenarios defined**: PASS - Each user story has 7-8 detailed acceptance scenarios in Given-When-Then format.
6. **Edge cases identified**: PASS - 8 edge cases documented covering duplicate names, deletion, overflow, clipboard fallback, division by zero, etc.
7. **Scope bounded**: PASS - "Out of Scope" section clearly excludes 9 features (multi-user collaboration, templates, import/export, archiving, undo/redo, bulk operations, versioning, advanced search, external integrations).
8. **Dependencies and assumptions**: PASS - 10 assumptions documented, 3 dependencies identified.

### Feature Readiness: ✅ PASS

1. **Requirements have acceptance criteria**: PASS - All 16 functional requirements map to acceptance scenarios in the user stories.
2. **User scenarios cover primary flows**: PASS - Three prioritized user stories cover all requested functionality (CRUD operations, progress dashboard, command library).
3. **Measurable outcomes defined**: PASS - 8 success criteria provide concrete measurements for feature validation.
4. **No implementation leakage**: PASS - Spec maintains abstraction appropriate for business stakeholders.

## Overall Status: ✅ READY FOR PLANNING

All checklist items pass. The specification is complete, unambiguous, testable, and ready for `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify`.

## Notes

- **Constitution Compliance**: Spec includes Modularity Requirements (MR-001 to MR-004) and Separation of Concerns Requirements (SC-001 to SC-003) as mandated by constitution v1.2.0 Principles VI and VII.
- **Prioritization**: User stories are properly prioritized (P1 > P2 > P3) to enable incremental delivery.
- **Independent Testability**: Each user story can be developed, tested, and deployed independently as confirmed by "Independent Test" sections.
- **Data Model**: New entities (Command) and new fields (Project.description, Project.updatedAt) are clearly defined with backward compatibility considerations.
- **Edge Case Coverage**: Comprehensive edge cases ensure robust implementation planning.
